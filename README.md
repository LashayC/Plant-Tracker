## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

For this project, I first considered how I wanted data to go up to the database while making forms. From there it was a matter of making sure the data was returned in the correct format and rendering it.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Why initially I inserted an array into the database, I ended up not using it as I decided less is more for an app like this. It ended up looking cleaner on the client side as a result.

## Lessons Learned:

I really got to learn more about mongodb and how to manipulate data coming to and from from using its methods. The flexibility of it was amazing.
